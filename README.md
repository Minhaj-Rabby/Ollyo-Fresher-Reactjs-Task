This project is built using React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS for styling, and React Router DOM for routing. The Image Gallery website is designed to allow users to manage and organize multiple images. It features a prominent "feature image," the ability to select and delete images, and the unique ability to rearrange image positions via drag-and-drop.




## Features

- **Feature Image:** One image can be designated as the "feature image" and is displayed prominently in a larger size compared to other images.

- **Select and Delete:** Users can select multiple images and delete them from the gallery.

- **Add Images:** You can add new images to the gallery.

- **Reorder Images:** The most distinctive feature of this website is the ability to drag and drop images to change their positions. Images can be reordered from left-to-right (LTR) in the gallery.
